# C++ `std::vector` Implementations

This repository contains various examples demonstrating the use of `std::vector` in C++ (C++11 and above). Each file explores different ways to use and optimize `std::vector` in real-world scenarios.

## 1. Basic Usage
- **File**: [00.basic.cpp](./00.basic.cpp)  
- **Description**: Basic introduction to using `std::vector` in C++, demonstrating adding, accessing, and iterating through elements in a vector.

## 2. Add element to vector
- **File**: [01.push_back.cpp](./01.push_back.cpp)  
- **Description**: Basic introduction to add element with `push_back` to vector.

## 3. Delete element from vector
- **File**: [02.pop_back.cpp](./02.pop_back.cpp)  
- **Description**: Basic introduction to remove element with `pop_back` from vector.

## 4. Insert and delete elements
- **File**: [03.insert_erase.cpp](./03.insert_erase.cpp)
- **Description**: Basic introduction to Inserting and Deleting Elements with `insert` and `erase`.

## Usage

To compile and run the examples, use a C++11 or higher compliant compiler. For example, with `g++`:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 00.basic.cpp -o basic_usage
./basic_usage
```
